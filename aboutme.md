My name is Kenaniah Dodson. I am from Raleigh, NC, though I have lived all over North Carolina (go heels!). Though my background is in management, I am passionate about data science, and excited to build a career in this industry. I enjoy spending time with my wife, and my pug Winnie. I also enjoy...

- Running
- Coffee (who doesn't?)
- Every genre of music except country (sorry!)
- Hockey (go Canes!)
